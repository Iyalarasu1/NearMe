        <h3><p><i>As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, I don't have specific information about a school named "Saradha School." School names can be relatively common, and there might be several institutions with similar names around the world.

            If "Saradha School" is a specific school you are inquiring about, I recommend checking local directories, education department websites, or the school's official website for the most accurate and up-to-date information. Additionally, local news sources or educational organizations may provide details about schools in specific regions. Keep in mind that specific details about individual schools can change, so the latest and most accurate information can be obtained from local sources.</i></p></h3>
