        <h3><p><i>As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, there isn't a specific "Rani Fort" widely known in historical or geographical contexts. It's possible that the term refers to a local or lesser-known fort with the name "Rani," and details about such places might not be readily available in general knowledge sources.

            If "Rani Fort" is a more recent development or a specific location, I recommend checking local sources, travel guides, or official tourism websites for the most accurate and up-to-date information about this fort. Geographical names and landmarks can sometimes change or have variations that may not be widely recognized in broader contexts.</i></p>
